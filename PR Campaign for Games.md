# PR Campaigns for Games
This page explores how to plan and run a successful PR campaign for a game. These notes are based on a [GDC Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrZlSDngwH8) from 2018.

## 5 Phases of PR Campaign
### I. Setup
* Make a game that people care about
  * Understand the difference between Push PR and Pull PR. Push PR is when the campaign attempts to force/push an idea to the target audience. On the other hand, Pull PR is driven by player needs and the audience easily funnel in.
* Learn to talk about your game
  * **Friend test**: Pitch the game to close friends and observe their reactions to get a rough idea of player perception of the idea
  * **Short text**: 7 words or less that explain your game accompanied with a 2-3 second gif setting up the art style
  * **Long text**: 150-200 words describing the game


### Bonus notes: What sells a game?
* Quality of the game
* Brand of the development studio
* Media coverage
* Youtube, streamers, and influencers
* Availability in different platforms
* Social media presence

All of the above-mentioned contents help to sell the game but they individually are not just enough. There are games that are of high quality that doesn't perform well on steam, and games by a big studio that flop. But one thing that most certainly helps is **building a strong community** around the game.
