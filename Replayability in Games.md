# Replayability in games

Basic notes on what qualities make a game replayable and fond to look back on.

## 1. Novelty

Novelty is the quality of being new, original, or unusual. The best replayable games are the ones that feel new every time players start a new run. Different games have crafted such experiences through mechanics that carefully support such a design where the players discover and experience new content during a restart. Here's a non-exhaustive list of such mechanics:

- Procedurally generated level and other content
- Branching storyline with multiple endings
- Different starting classes
- Branching content such as skill trees
- Random ability, weapon drops, and encounters
  - The encounters provide unique challenges for the player to overcome, while random abilities provide the player with new ways to overcome these challenges.
  - Mix them both, and the replayability value of a game increases sigmoidally



When designing replayable games, designers must try and avoid staleness. Content such as rigid storyline, especially false choices will easily kill the game when players try to replay the game. Making a different choice but arriving at the same destination will be frowned upon by the players and they lose the trust they have with the developers and the game.



## 2. Creativity

The idea of creativity in games is all about the developers creating tools that let the players create their own content and story, and let them be the driver of the game. This type of game not only requires to have strong tools, but also a strong community around the game where users can share their creative progress. 

- User-generated content
- Sandbox games
- User-specific goals 
  - Like, in Hitman (2016), players can choose to eliminate only using indirect eliminations
  - Highly feasible in games with systemic design as the combination of possibilities make the game more interesting to the player

It is very important that designers communicate the existence of such tools and systems to the players because the last thing we want is players not using an awesome creative tool as they remained undiscovered. The most effective tool may not be the most creative tool, so if it suits the game, the designers must consider adding systems that limit the usage of the same tool to force the player to come up with creative solutions.

Another pitfall with users sharing creative content over the internet is the servers themselves. A game can go from highly replayable to not playable if the servers go down (temporarily and worse when they go down permanently).



## 3. Evolution

These games get their replay value based on player's mastery as they get better over time. Casual arcade games (such as Tetris) and competitive multiplayer games (such as Super Smash Bros.) highly rely on evolution to make the game replayable. 

Other Elements such as leaderboards help support this idea because what's better than proving yourself that you're skilled? Showing off to others that you're skilled. But again this cannot exist in its own little shell. Multiplayer games such as League of Legends release patches every 2 weeks and shift their meta to prevent stagnation in games. 

- Difficulty options
- Leaderboards
- Evolution to the game's meta (can be considered as novelty as well)
- Performance-based ranking on level completion
- Community driven mastery
  - Example, speedrunning, no-death, etc.
